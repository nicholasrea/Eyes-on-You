# Eyes
## Exercise on eyes
<img src= "oneeye.png" width='300'/>

Here were were challanged to utilize CSS styles to build an animation.  The eyes are alaways on you, in that they are tracking the cursor.  

## Roadmap for future

There isn't a whole lot of added value that I can think of at the moment.  Possibly adding a timeOut that would make the eyes appear to blink, also making more anatomically correct.
